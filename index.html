      <h2 class="titlette">What is Long Island Tedium?</h2>
      <p>Long Island Tedium is an art collective dedicated to bringing obscure comedic tedium into content examining the minutiae minute by minute.  We're working the rat race too though, so even though things move slow, you betta believe there ain't no sleazy producer or marketing team we answer to.  That being said, if you are indeed a sleazy producer or marketing team looking to waste money and would like to sponsor and/or produce an episode of something or whatever, inquiries may be directed to us at the contact page.</p>

      <p>In order to maximize compatibility this page has been designed with Internet Explorer 5 in mind.  While netscape navigator may work, there's a good chance you aren't getting the full picture.  But in all seriousness, this simple and dated design fits the purpose of Long Island Tedium like that pair of pants that you like but your friends have tried to throw away because they're covered in chef boyardee stains.</p>
